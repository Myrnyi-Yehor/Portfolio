# Portfolio
- [Project 1](https://github.com/Myrnyi-Yehor/Online-store-sales-analytics) - Connected to Google BigQuery via Python and built an integrated dataset of user, session, and product data. Analyzed sales dynamics, top countries, product categories, and traffic channels using SQL and Python. Applied statistical methods (correlation, hypothesis testing) to study user behavior and group differences.
- [Project 2](https://github.com/Myrnyi-Yehor/Analysis-of-A-B-testing-results) - Applied statistical methods (e.g., hypothesis testing, confidence intervals) to analyze A/B test results. Evaluated key conversion metrics to assess the impact of different test variants. Developed data visualizations in Python to clearly present findings and support decision-making.
